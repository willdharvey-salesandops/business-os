description: Generate daily brief with TOP 2 priorities and quick win. Start each day with clarity.
---

Start the day by generating a focused daily brief.

## Data Sources

Read these files (if they exist):
- `workspace/foundations/tasks.md` - Current task list
- `workspace/foundations/gains.md` - Recent wins for context
- `workspace/foundations/daily-brief.md` - Yesterday's brief

## Process

1. **Gather Context**: Understand current priorities and recent progress
2. **Check Outreach Pipeline**: Query Supabase via the campaigns API to check:
   - Any follow-ups due (prospects sent 2+ days ago without reply)
   - Campaigns with approved emails ready to send
   - Overall pipeline stats (sent, replied, pending)
3. **Select TOP 2 Tasks**: Choose the two most important tasks based on:
   - Revenue impact
   - Strategic importance
   - What will move the needle most
4. **Break Down Tasks**: For each TOP 2, create 2-4 concrete subtasks
5. **Choose Quick Win**: Select one 10-15 minute task for momentum

## Output

Write to `workspace/foundations/daily-brief.md`:

```markdown
## Daily Brief - {Day, Month Date, Year}
